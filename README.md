# NETWORK-BASED-ANALYSIS-OF-ROAD-ACCIDENT-HOTSPOTS-FOR-SAFER-URBAN-MOBILITY

Road accidents remain a critical public safety concern, especially in urban areas where traffic density is high and infrastructure is often stressed. This project aims to analyze accident-prone intersections using a graph-based approach to identify high-risk zones and provide actionable insights for traffic management and city planning.

In this work, intersections will be represented as nodes and roads as edges, forming a road network graph. Accident frequency data will be overlaid onto the network, allowing the identification of patterns in accident occurrences. The project will apply network analysis techniques including centrality measures to find influential intersections, and community detection algorithms to highlight clusters of accident-prone regions. Visualization of these hotspots will make patterns more interpretable for decision-makers.

The expected outcome is a ranked list and visual map of high-risk intersections along with clusters of roads requiring immediate attention. These insights can help traffic police prioritize enforcement, guide city planners in designing safer road layouts, and inform awareness campaigns targeting the most vulnerable areas.

By combining accident data with social network analysis methodologies, this project provides a data-driven framework for enhancing road safety and reducing accident rates, ultimately contributing to safer and more sustainable urban mobility.
